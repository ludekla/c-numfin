## Numerical Methods in Finance with C

# About

This is an exercise in object-oriented C coding and quantitive finance. 

The code is the C adaptation of the code in the book with the same title, 
mutatis mutandis (see below). Of particular interest - performance 
gain aside - is the task of having to find a different approach and sometimes 
even being forced to rethink the problem.

The models themselves are not cutting edge. But who knowns how this repo
will evolve.
