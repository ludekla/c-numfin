## Numerical Methods in Finance with C

# About

This is an exercise in object-oriented C coding and quantitive finance. 

The code is the C adaptation of the code in the book 

*Capi≈Ñski, Tomasz Zastawniak: Numerical Methods in Finance with C++ (CUP 2014)*.

Of particular interest - performance gain aside - is the task of having to find a 
different approach and sometimes even being forced to rethink the problem.

The models themselves are not cutting edge. But who knowns how this repo
will evolve.

# Remark

We use *doxygen* code documentation.
